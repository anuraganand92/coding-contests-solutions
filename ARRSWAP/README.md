Chef has two arrays AA and BB of the same size NN.

In one operation, Chef can:

    Choose two integers ii and jj (1≤i,j≤N)(1≤i,j≤N) and swap the elements AiAi​ and BjBj​.

Chef came up with a task to find the minimum possible value of (Amax−AminAmax​−Amin​) after performing the swap operation any (possibly zero) number of times.

Since Chef is busy, can you help him solve this task?

Note that AmaxAmax​ and AminAmin​ denote the maximum and minimum elements of the array AA respectively.
